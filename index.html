        <h1>Daily Utility Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 24, 2025</p>

        <p>Daily Utility (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the Daily Utility app (“the App”). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App collects the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Task Data:</strong> Information you input into the App, such as task titles, descriptions, due dates, priorities, and reminder times. This data is stored locally on your device in an SQLite database.</li>
            <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Settings you configure in the App, such as notification preferences, time formats, and sort orders, stored using SharedPreferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Exported Data:</strong> When you export tasks, the App creates a JSON file containing your task data, which you can save to a location of your choice on your device.</li>
            <li><strong>Permissions Data:</strong> The App requests permissions for notifications (to send task reminders and daily summaries) and storage access (to export and import tasks as JSON files).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information collected for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To provide the App’s core functionality, such as managing your tasks, sending reminders, and displaying daily summaries.</li>
            <li>To save your preferences and settings to enhance your user experience.</li>
            <li>To allow you to export and import your tasks for backup and transfer purposes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The App does not transmit your data over the internet, share it with third parties, or use it for advertising purposes.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>All data entered into the App is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Task data is stored in an SQLite database on your device.</li>
            <li>User preferences are stored using Android’s SharedPreferences.</li>
            <li>Exported task data is saved as a JSON file in a location you specify.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not have access to your data, and the App does not upload your data to any servers. However, you are responsible for securing your device to prevent unauthorized access to your data.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not share your data with third parties, except in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you export your tasks, the JSON file is stored in a location you choose, and you are responsible for how that file is shared or stored.</li>
            <li>If required by law, we may disclose your data to comply with legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can delete your task data at any time by deleting tasks within the App or uninstalling the App, which removes the SQLite database.</li>
            <li>You can manage notification and storage permissions through your device’s settings.</li>
            <li>The App provides options to export and import your tasks, giving you control over your data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App does not currently integrate with third-party services, analytics tools, or advertising networks. If this changes in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>

        <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, please contact us to have it removed.</p>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated policy will be available within the App, and the “Last Updated” date will reflect the date of the most recent changes. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
